Please analyze the following conversation and identify the roles of each speaker.
Assume this is a counseling session. Determine how many clients there are and assign roles to each speaker ID.
Note that speech diarization might be inaccurate, so multiple speaker IDs might actually belong to the same person.
Number of client is undecided, but it should be 1 or more, and less than 5.
         
**Guidelines for Role Identification**

**Counselor**  
- Uses open‑ended questions to encourage elaboration (e.g., “How did that make you feel?”, “What was going through your mind at that moment?”)  
- Reflects and paraphrases the client’s statements to demonstrate understanding (e.g., “So, you’re saying that…”, “It sounds like…”).  
- Validates emotions with empathetic language (e.g., “I hear how difficult that was for you.”)  
- Guides gently without prescribing solutions, inviting the client to find their own answers.  
- Maintains a calm, supportive tone—steady pace and soft inflection.  
- Occasionally interrupts to clarify or summarize (e.g., “Let me pause you there—what I’m hearing is…”).  
- Periodically summarizes key points to keep the session on track (e.g., “To recap what you’ve shared so far…”).

**Client**  
- Expresses personal feelings, emotional states, and lived experiences (e.g., “I feel really anxious.” / “Last week, this happened…”).  
- Speaks in first‑person (“I feel…”, “I experienced…”).  
- Shares concrete examples or memories from their life.  
- May ask for advice, reassurance, or confirmation (e.g., “Is this normal?”, “What should I do?”).  
- Shows emotional shifts or distress signals (pauses, voice tremors, sighs).  
- At times hesitates or self‑edits, reflecting difficulty in expressing feelings.
